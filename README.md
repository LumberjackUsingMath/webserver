# Multithreaded Webserver implemented using Java


### Description: 
This a Maven project that uses the Maven standard project structure. It implements a webserver that serves files, which 
can be requested by HTTP requests of version 1.1 . As I focused to make a proof of concept, I only implemented 
the GET request. In particular, the GET request specifies the requested txt file in the header
"requestedFile". 


## Main Resource:
The main resource for this implementation is this [repository](https://github.com/warchildmd/webserver).
I adjusted the code a little, in order to show some contribution, which included bug fixing.
### Changes
1. Reduced functionality 
2. Request file by header
3. Different logging 
4. Different project structure 
5. Added keep-alive behaviour

### My prerequisites :
1. I did not know what a Maven project is.
2. my Java skills were from a university course from 2019, so my code is very junior. 
3. I used an REST API via Python once
4. I did not know the HTTP protocol 

Now I know all of them. So, thank you very much for the challenge.
